Pyber Analysis
• Goal
Visualize, through data analysis, the information provided by Omar, who wishes to know the total number of trips made by drivers by geographical zones, as well as the total number of existing drivers by zone and the rates that are handled.
• Analysis
In the exploration of the information, we managed to know the total number of trips made by types of cities, say rural, semi-urban and urban areas, yielding the following figures.
Total trips
• Rural: 125 trips.
• Suburban: 625 trips
• Urban: 1,625 trips.
Total drivers
• Rural: 78 drivers
• Suburban: 490 drivers
• Urban: 2,405 drivers
There is a greater total of trips in the urban area as well as the number of drivers is greater, this is due to the fact that having a greater number of inhabitants increases the amount of demand for the service.
Average fare per ride
• Rural: 34.623440
• Suburban: 30.970128
• City: 24.525772
A disadvantage for urban areas is that since they have a greater demand for the service, the rates must be lower, unlike in rural and suburban areas, despite the fact that the total rates are higher in the urban area.
According to the sum per week during 2019 and as the weeks progressed, the rates increased, being the lowest in the rural area and the highest in the urban area.

Recommendations.
1. In rural areas, as they have higher rates, there is less possibility that the inhabitants of such geographical areas are minors, since it would be necessary to know the total distance to travel and if it is necessary to use this type of service.
2. For the suburban areas, the rates had a moderately considerable increase even though it is considered the same as the rural areas since it is considered that the service may not be very busy.
3. For the urban area, it should be considered that the rates may be lower if the service continues to increase and the number of drivers increases, which may reduce the service per driver.
