PyBer Analysis
•	Goal
Know the total number of trips, the total number of drivers and the total rates for each type of city.
•	Analysis
In this data analysis, we managed to know the number of existing drivers by the type of geographical area in which we are living, understood as urban, suburban and rural areas.
According to our results we can observe the following points:
The urban area is the one with the highest influx of drivers, due to the number of inhabitants who are living in this type of area.
Suburban areas yielded an unexpected result as they were expected to have a below-average influx of drivers.
The rural area has a lower influx of drivers, due to the number of inhabitants, which is why it is considered the best place to make trips.
•	Recommendations
In urban areas, according to the affluence, it is the best point to carry out commercial business since there is the possibility of growth in a higher percentage.
For suburban areas, good commercial management can be achieved due to the type of rates.
In rural areas, according to the rates, it is recommended to have a controlled influx since the rates have been increasing and this could affect trade.
